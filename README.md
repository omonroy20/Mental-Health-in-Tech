# Mental-Health-in-Tech
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey . I found this data set in Kaggle and thought it would be interesting to analyze it and try to find any trends. For this analysis (the part 1 analysis at least), I wanted to do an EDA and see if men and women answered the survey in different ways and see which questions/variables they were.  Here, you'll see a ton of graphs from the EDA I performed, data cleaning within R, Fisher's Tests to see which variables were significantly different by gender, and Random Forest models to determine if it's possible to create a model that can predict the gender using the available survey answers. Spoilers: It was only good at predicting which of the survey takers were male. It should be noted that as of 05/24/22, I have only uploaded part 1 of the analysis. I plan to do more analysis on this data set and see if I can extract any more info from it. I'll also be doing different data sets in the meantime too.
